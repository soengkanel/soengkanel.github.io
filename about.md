## 🚀 Welcome to the Future

This blog is where **algorithms meet intuition**, **AI meets practicality**, and **complex ideas become crystal clear**.

I break down the tech that's shaping tomorrow—from neural networks to enterprise systems—into concepts you can actually use today.

## 🤖 What You'll Find Here

**AI & Algorithms** - Deep learning, machine learning, and the math that makes it all work (explained like a human, not a textbook)

**Enterprise Tech** - Real-world insights from scaling Business Central to 10,000+ users and building big data pipelines

**Science & Research** - From bioelectricity to experimental design, exploring the cutting edge

**Practical Wisdom** - No fluff. Just actionable knowledge you can apply immediately.

## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm **Kanel SOENG**—a technologist who's spent 15+ years building everything from banking systems in France to big data platforms in Cambodia.

**Current mission:** Technical Consultant driving Microsoft Dynamics 365 & Azure solutions at enterprise scale

**Past adventures:**
- 🎓 Math Professor teaching Computer Science (making calculus cool since 2020)
- 📊 Big Data Engineer reducing processing times by 75% with Hadoop/Spark
- 💻 Software Engineer at Cegid, crafting payment systems for banks

**Education:** Engineer's Degree in Computer Science (Government scholarship, Hanoi University)

**Languages:** Khmer, English, Vietnamese, French (because why not?)
