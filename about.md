## 👋 Hey! I'm Kanel

I love building cool tech and explaining it in ways that actually make sense. 

**What I do:** Turn complex AI, algorithms, and enterprise systems into "aha!" moments.

**Why I do it:** Because technology should be fun, not frustrating. 💡

## 🎯 Quick Hits

- 🤖 **15+ years** building everything from French banking systems to Cambodian big data platforms
- 📚 **Math Professor** by day, making calculus unexpectedly cool
- ⚡ **Technical Consultant**  Dynamics 365 BC & Azure
- 🌍 Speaks 4 languages: Khmer, English, Vietnamese, French

**My vibe:** If you can't explain it simply, you don't get it. Every post here = clarity + fun.
