Every day contains hundreds of decisions. Most are trivial, but a few have outsized impact. This article presents frameworks for making better decisions, especially under uncertainty.

## Decision Quality vs. Outcome Quality

A good decision can lead to bad outcomes (bad luck).
A bad decision can lead to good outcomes (good luck).

**Evaluate decisions by process, not results.**

```
Decision quality = f(information available, reasoning applied)
Outcome quality = f(decision quality, chance)
```

Focus on improving decision process, not predicting outcomes.

## The Expected Value Framework

For quantifiable decisions:

```
Expected Value = Σ (Probability × Payoff)

Example: Should I take this job offer?
- 70% chance it works out: +$50K value
- 30% chance it doesn't: -$10K value

EV = (0.7 × $50K) + (0.3 × -$10K) = $32K

Positive EV → Take the job
```

**Limitations**:
- Probabilities are often unknown
- Some outcomes can't be quantified
- Ignores variance/risk preferences

## Reversibility Analysis

Categorize decisions by reversibility:

**Type 1 (Irreversible)**: Take time, gather information
- Major career changes
- Large financial commitments
- Relationship decisions

**Type 2 (Reversible)**: Decide quickly, adjust later
- Most business decisions
- Experiments and tests
- Preferences and routines

**Error**: Treating Type 2 decisions like Type 1 (analysis paralysis)

## The Pre-Mortem Technique

Before committing to a decision, imagine it failed spectacularly.

```
Pre-mortem process:
1. Assume the decision was made and failed
2. Write down all reasons for failure
3. Assess likelihood of each failure mode
4. Develop mitigation strategies
5. Decide if risks are acceptable
```

This surfaces risks that optimism obscures.

## Second-Order Thinking

First-order: What happens immediately?
Second-order: What happens as a consequence of that?

```
Decision: Offer 50% discount to boost sales

First-order effects:
- Sales increase short-term
- Revenue per unit decreases

Second-order effects:
- Customers expect future discounts
- Brand perceived as lower value
- Competitors respond with discounts
- Margins compressed industry-wide

The second-order effects may outweigh first-order benefits.
```

Always ask: "And then what?"

## Inversion

Instead of asking how to succeed, ask how to fail.

```
Question: How do I build a successful career?
Inverted: How would I guarantee career failure?

Failure recipe:
- Never develop new skills
- Burn professional relationships
- Miss deadlines consistently
- Avoid difficult problems
- Blame others for setbacks

Success strategy: Do the opposite of the failure recipe.
```

Inversion reveals obvious errors that direct thinking misses.

## The Eisenhower Matrix

For prioritization decisions:

```
                    Urgent          Not Urgent
                ┌─────────────┬─────────────────┐
Important       │ DO FIRST    │ SCHEDULE        │
                │ Crises,     │ Planning,       │
                │ Deadlines   │ Development     │
                ├─────────────┼─────────────────┤
Not Important   │ DELEGATE    │ ELIMINATE       │
                │ Interrupts, │ Time wasters,   │
                │ Some emails │ Busy work       │
                └─────────────┴─────────────────┘
```

Most people spend too much time in "Urgent/Not Important" quadrant.

## Weighted Decision Matrix

For decisions with multiple criteria:

```
Job offer comparison:

Criteria        Weight   Job A   Job B   Job C
─────────────────────────────────────────────
Salary           0.25      8       6       9
Growth           0.30      9       7       5
Location         0.15      5       8       7
Culture          0.20      7       9       6
Stability        0.10      6       8       8
─────────────────────────────────────────────
Weighted Score           7.45    7.35    6.65

Job A wins, though not by much.
```

**Process**:
1. List criteria
2. Assign weights (must sum to 1)
3. Score each option (1-10)
4. Calculate weighted sum
5. Use as input, not final answer

## Managing Cognitive Biases

**Confirmation bias**: Seek disconfirming evidence actively
**Sunk cost fallacy**: Ask "Would I start this today with what I know?"
**Availability bias**: Seek base rates and statistics
**Anchoring**: Generate your own estimate before seeing others'

## Decision Journal

Track decisions to improve over time:

```
Decision journal entry:
- Date:
- Decision:
- Options considered:
- Key factors:
- Expected outcome:
- Confidence level (1-10):
- Actual outcome (filled later):
- What I learned:
```

Review quarterly to identify patterns in your decision-making.

## Conclusion

Better decisions come from better processes, not better predictions. Build frameworks into habits, track results, and iterate. The compound effect of marginally better decisions is enormous over time.
