To build an Elite Intelligence cell, you don't look for "employees." You look for **Assets**. Inspired by the high-pressure environments of Unit 8200 and Mossad, this protocol outlines the exact setup for your team.

## 👥 Phase I: The Archetypes (Who to Recruit)

Don't hire for "Years of Experience." Hire for **Cognitive Agility**. Assign your current team members to these archetypes based on their natural instincts:

<div class="persona-card">
    <h4>1. The "Katsa" (Case Officer) — Desk A / Desk D</h4>
    <p><strong>Trait:</strong> High empathy + High manipulation + Extreme clarity.</p>
    <p><strong>Role:</strong> They talk to people, gather human intel (HUMINT), and package the final output. If you need to convince a client or a stakeholder, this is your operator.</p>
</div>

<div class="persona-card">
    <h4>2. The "Yakhalam" (The Specialist) — Desk C</h4>
    <p><strong>Trait:</strong> Deep technical obsession. They don't sleep until the code works.</p>
    <p><strong>Role:</strong> They are the builders. They take the "impossible" idea from intelligence and turn it into a working prototype in 48 hours.</p>
</div>

<div class="persona-card">
    <h4>3. The "Tenth Man" (The Contrarian) — Desk B</h4>
    <p><strong>Trait:</strong> Low agreeableness + Extremely high logic.</p>
    <p><strong>Role:</strong> Their sole job is to tell you why you are wrong. They must be protected by the leader. If they stop criticizing, your intelligence is failing.</p>
</div>

## ⚡ Phase II: The "Rapid Setup" (The First 48 Hours)

A team is just a group of people until they have a **Rhythm**. Set this up tomorrow:

<div class="tactical-box">
    <h4>The 48-Hour Checklist</h4>
    <div class="check-item">
        <span class="step-indicator">1</span>
        <span><strong>The "Dead Drop" Channel:</strong> Create a Signal or Slack channel called <code>#intel-raw</code>. Anyone can post any link/insight here, but NO chatting. Just data.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="check-item">
        <span class="step-indicator">2</span>
        <span><strong>The "Brief" Template:</strong> Every insight must follow the: <i>Target | Insight | Action</i> format. No long emails.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="check-item">
        <span class="step-indicator">3</span>
        <span><strong>The Daily Stand-up (09:00):</strong> 10 minutes max. "What is our highest value target today?" and "What is blocking Desk C?"</span>
    </div>
</div>

## 📡 Phase III: Communication Protocols

In elite cells, communication has zero friction. Use the **Mossad Logic of Brevity**:

<table class="comms-table">
    <tr style="background: var(--bg-tertiary);">
        <td><strong>Context</strong></td>
        <td><strong>Protocol</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Critical Failure</td>
        <td>"Status: Red. [The Problem]. Need [Specifically What]."</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Internal Debate</td>
        <td>"Tenth Man View: [Why we are wrong]."</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>New Opportunity</td>
        <td>"Target Identified: [Link/Data]. Desk A investigating."</td>
    </tr>
</table>

## 🛡️ The Unit 8200 Training Motto: "Do it, then improve it."

Elite intelligence doesn't wait for the "Final Version." We ship **Protocol 0.1** immediately. If it works, we scale. If it fails, we debrief and pivot in hours, not months.

### 🧭 Next Mission:
Identify your **Tenth Man**. Give them permission to challenge your top three projects this week. Report the results.

*In <strong>Protocol 003: Technical Arsenal</strong>, we will configure the AI tools needed to automate these Desks.*
