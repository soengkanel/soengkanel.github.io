The landscape of Microsoft Business Central is undergoing a seismic shift. As we move through 2024 and into 2025, Microsoft is doubling down on a cloud-first, AI-driven strategy. For vendors, partners, and consultant agencies, these aren't just incremental updates—they are fundamental changes to the business model.

From the first licensing price increase in five years to the aggressive sunsetting of on-premises options, here is what you need to know to navigate this evolving ecosystem.

## 1. The Financial Shift: Licensing Price Increases

For the first time in five years, Microsoft has announced a price increase for Business Central licenses, effective **October 1, 2025**.

### The Impact
- **Essentials License**: Projected to rise from ~$70 to ~$80 per user/month.
- **Premium License**: Projected to rise from ~$100 to ~$110 per user/month.
- **Device License**: Projected to rise from ~$40 to ~$45 per user/month.

### Why the Change?
Microsoft attributes this to the significant value added through AI (Copilot) capabilities, increased storage limits (which are increasing by 33-67%), and advanced analytics features.

### For Partners and Consultants
This means difficult conversations with clients are on the horizon. Partners must be proactive, helping customers understand the value proposition of the new pricing—specifically focusing on the productivity gains from the included AI features and storage expansions.

## 2. The End of an Era: On-Premises Changes

The message is clear: **Cloud is King.**

Starting **April 1, 2025**, Microsoft will discontinue the option for *new* customers to purchase Business Central On-Premises licenses. New deployments will be subscription-only.

For existing on-premises customers, the pressure to migrate is increasing financially. The **Enhancement Plan rate** has already increased from 18% to 19% as of October 2024.

### Strategic Pivot for Agencies
Consultancies that have built their business around on-premises maintenance must pivot. The "Bridge to the Cloud 2" program offers incentives, and the primary role of the consultant is now to be the architect of this migration.

## 3. The AI Revolution: Copilot Integration

AI is no longer a buzzword; it's a core feature. The 2024 and 2025 release waves are heavily focused on **Copilot**.

- **Automation**: Autonomous agents are being introduced to handle complex tasks like order processing.
- **Analysis**: Real-time financial analysis and data entry automation are becoming standard.

### The Opportunity
For vendors and ISVs, this is a call to innovate. Extensions and apps that don't leverage AI will soon look outdated. Partners need to upskill their teams not just in AL development, but in prompt engineering and AI integration to deliver the "modern" experience customers now expect.

## 4. Partner Program Evolution

The traditional "Silver" and "Gold" competencies are gone. As of **January 21, 2025**, legacy benefits will be terminated.

Partners must now achieve the **Solutions Partner** designation. This new model emphasizes:
- **Performance**: Net new customer adds.
- **Skilling**: Certified staff.
- **Customer Success**: Usage growth and deployment.

### Action Item
Agencies must audit their current standing. Failing to meet the new requirements could mean losing access to critical internal use rights (IURs) and incentives.

## Conclusion

The changes coming to the Microsoft ecosystem are designed to accelerate the move to the cloud and the adoption of AI. For partners, vendors, and consultants, the "business as usual" approach is no longer viable. The winners in this new era will be those who embrace the price changes as a value-add conversation, lead the charge in cloud migration, and deeply integrate AI into their service offerings.
