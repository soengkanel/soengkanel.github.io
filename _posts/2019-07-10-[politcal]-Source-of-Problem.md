There are so many views on problem definition. They try to put the problem on sides of other and escape from the frame of responsibility. This is becoming common and people usually do it, then it becomes attitude from daily behavior. From this essay, I would suggest reader to stop finding place where problem should be put, but to find where they come from. My opinion, I think that problem comes from 2 main sources.

Basically and first step to identify where those problem come from, people need to roughly consider from their internal. Try your best to think whether it is because of you or not. Any problem could happen because of you anytime, so don’t say that “it’s impossible that I can create trouble!” Even you found out that you involve only 0.00001% in this mistake, you need yourself to pay back worthily to that amount. When you say “SORRY”, don’t worry, you will not die. I mean, say “SORRY” to the 0.00001% mistake you made. If the mistake comes from you, then fix yours site first. Then, naturally, your authority of correcting others will come. The power of accepting your own mistake, even a small piece, and correcting yourself is very strong in order to disable complaining from others. Simultaneously, if you keep changing others without looking at your own mistake, there’s no use. Be a change maker!

Secondly, sources from others are automatically judged by people in their daily life, no matter what. They always come with their insight that “Haaaaa! This is not my mistake…”, always. So yeah, trouble could not happen by itself, there’s a cause. There is no such thing as something for nothing. So if others involve in the problem, change also need to apply. Even though you try to change yourself to a perfect person, but there is no use if others don’t. Linked to the previous paragraph, of course, you have to correct yourself first then start correcting other.

These two processes will make the whole situation goes better. Comparing to your stomach health, taking medicine is a part to cure. But being on a diet is another component to make it permanent cured. No matter how much medicine you take, if you are not on the diet, your stomachache will happen again and again. So in this case, you can see; taking medicine as fixing others and being on diet is fixing yourself.

Overall, just to alert people under one sky that, to make one problem successfully solved; you need to fix first from you side, although it is just a small piece in a big mistake. Then make other side better, if you can. But I believe that, from accepting and correcting your own trouble is powerful enough to influence others own trouble is powerful enough to influence others.
