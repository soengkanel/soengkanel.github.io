I think a healthy company deals with conflict all the time. I think the nuance is that most people have a negative connotation of the word conflict -- they think of it as a bad thing. They picture an argument with raised voices and high tension. It doesn't have to be that way, though. Conflict between people who have a shared goal is really just a matter of exploring different perspectives, contexts, and needs, getting it all on the table to identify the tradeoffs that make the most sense at the time.
