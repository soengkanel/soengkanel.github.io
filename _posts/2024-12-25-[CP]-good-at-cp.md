title: CP| How to Be Good at Competitive Programming
---

Competitive programming (CP) requires practice, consistency, and a strategic approach. Here’s a roadmap to help you become proficient:

## 1. Learn the Fundamentals
- **Data Structures**: Master arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, hash maps, trees, graphs, and heaps.
- **Algorithms**: Study sorting, searching, dynamic programming, graph traversal (BFS, DFS), shortest path algorithms (Dijkstra, Floyd-Warshall), and divide-and-conquer techniques.
- **Mathematics**: Be comfortable with number theory, combinatorics, modular arithmetic, and probability.

## 2. Choose a Programming Language
- Use a language widely supported in CP platforms, like **C++**, **Python**, or **Java**.
- C++ is particularly popular for its Standard Template Library (STL) and execution speed.

## 3. Get Familiar with Platforms
- Practice on platforms like:
  - **Codeforces**: Great for contests and community support.
  - **LeetCode**: Ideal for data structure and algorithm practice.
  - **AtCoder**: Known for clean and challenging problems.
  - **HackerRank**, **CodeChef**, and **TopCoder**.

## 4. Follow a Practice Plan
- **Beginner**: Solve easy problems to build confidence.
- **Intermediate**: Focus on specific topics. Solve 3-4 problems daily.
- **Advanced**: Solve harder problems, participate in contests, and upsolve (redo unsolved contest problems).

## 5. Analyze and Upsolve
- After contests, review editorial solutions for problems you couldn’t solve.
- Reimplement those solutions to ensure understanding.

## 6. Work on Problem-Solving Speed
- **Time Management**: Practice solving problems under timed conditions.
- **Typing Speed**: Faster coding saves valuable seconds during contests.
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify problem types quickly (e.g., greedy, dynamic programming).

## 7. Learn Advanced Topics
- **Dynamic Programming on Trees**
- **Segment Trees and Fenwick Trees**
- **Bitmasking**
- **Suffix Arrays/Trie**
- **Heavy-Light Decomposition**

## 8. Develop Debugging Skills
- Use print statements or a debugger to trace errors.
- Test your code with edge cases.

## 9. Stay Consistent
- Solve problems daily.
- Maintain a streak, even if it’s just solving one problem a day.

## 10. Participate in Contests
- Compete regularly to get used to pressure and time constraints.
- Platforms like Codeforces and AtCoder host weekly contests.

## 11. Learn from the Community
- Follow competitive programmers like **Errichto**, **William Lin**, or **tourist** on YouTube.
- Join CP communities and forums to discuss strategies and problems.

## 12. Track Progress
- Maintain a record of solved problems.
- Gradually increase the difficulty level of problems you tackle.

## 13. Stay Motivated
- Set achievable goals.
- Celebrate small wins to stay positive.
